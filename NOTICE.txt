Additional terms

The following disclaimer must be held together with any risk score score generated by this code.
If the score is displayed, then this disclaimer must be displayed or otherwise be made easily accessible, e.g. by a prominent link alongside it.
  The initial version of this file, to be found at http://svn.clinrisk.co.uk/opensource/qrisk2, faithfully implements QRISK3-2017.

  ClinRisk Ltd. stress, therefore, that it is the responsibility of the end user to check that the source that they receive produces the same
  results as the original code found at https://qrisk.org.
  Inaccurate implementations of risk scores can lead to wrong patients being given the wrong treatment.
